# libgithub

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/briandowns/libgithub/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/briandowns/libgithub/actions/workflows/compile_example.yml/badge.svg)

libgithub is a C client library for accessing the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en) and has been tested on Linux (Debian variants), MacOS, and FreeBSD with GCC and Clang, amd64 and arm64 architectures.

## Usage

To initialize the library, the user's github token is required.

```c
gh_client_init(token);
```

Clean up after use.
```c
gh_client_free();
```

### Error Handling

If an error occurs during the call, the error will be put into the `response->err_msg` field and `response->resp` will be set to `NULL`.

```c
gh_client_response_t *res = gh_client_repo_release_by_tag("briandowns", "spinner", "v1.29.16");
if (res->err_msg != NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", res->err_msg);
    gh_client_response_free(res);
}
```
